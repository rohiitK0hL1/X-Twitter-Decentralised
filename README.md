# Decentralized Twitter-Like dApp

This project is a blockchain-powered decentralized application (dApp) that emulates the basic functionalities of Twitter. Instead of relying on centralized servers, it uses blockchain technology, requiring users to connect a blockchain wallet and pay transaction fees to save posts securely on-chain.

## Key Features

- **Post tweets**: Save posts directly to the blockchain.
- **Browse tweets**: View posts from all users on the network.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity**: For writing and deploying smart contracts.
- **Hardhat**: For compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts to the blockchain.
- **Vue.js (Vue 3)**: For building the user-facing application.
- **MetaMask**: For wallet integration and Ethereum interaction.

## Prerequisites

- **Alchemy API Key**: For interacting with Ethereum nodes.
- **MetaMask Wallet**: For signing transactions and blockchain authentication.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd decentralized-twitter
